After disassembly I hooked the 4-cell battery up to my lab UPS\novernight in the bathroom and got it to boot (yay for just-in-time backups).\nI suppose a more hands-on hacker would call it a success and keep going, the\nroughed-up chassis, caused by prying it open with a screwdriver, worn as a\ntoken of honor from the field of battle. But not me.\nWe ordered a new machine, a fun and crazy laptop-tablet thing, called Asus ROG\nFlow Z13. It comes with Windows 11 and some crap from Asus. Oh well, let’s\nput Linux on it and see how it goes.\n#arch linux pt. 1\nMy previous laptop ran Arch, so I “etched” a new USB with 2025.03.01. The first thing\nthe installer suggests is connecting to the internet, and well fuck_:\nNo matter what I tried, iw did not manage to connect to my Wi-Fi. I no\nlonger have dmesg logs, but all connection attempts failed within 200ms,\nincluding retries…\nSo I said fuck this, searched around and found Bazzite. I’m no longer playing\nvideogames as much but a gaming-focused distro with patches for the Z13?\nThat’ll do.\n#Bazzite for software dev.\nBazzite is built on Fedora and I have no opinions on\nFedora. After going through the unfamiliar motions of bootstrapping\nan atomic system (i.e. image-based so system upgrade is just an image swap,\nbut no clue if that’s a useful definition of atomicity but w/e), I kind of\nreached a decent status quo:\n\nWi-Fi works, woho!\nInstall all dev things in a distrobox (including sublime text)\nBind Mod+Enter to run distrobox enter dev\nInstall Niri WM\n\nBut the way there was quite painful, as it usually is when doing\ntrial-by-error w/o reading the fucking manual:\n\nCool glitchy rendering artifacts (courtesy of amdgpu driver?) – went away with Niri!\nFighting a distro that said “no! that’s against the law!” instead of “you brake it, you fix it”\nRead fish config loading order ~20 times …\nCould not install Sublime Text for shit, until I tried it inside a distrobox! Cool moment when it worked.\nSome flatpaks work, some not… and I have no idea why.\n\nOh well, finally done.\nThis worked quite okay for couple of weeks and system upgrades until I started\nto get strange errors, probably due to my bad practice of not putting\neverything dev-related inside the distrobox container.\nThen April came and I said, let’s try again with arch 2025.04.01.\n#arch linux pt. 2\nYeah, no. Wi-Fi was still broken.\nSo over the weekend I did what any self-respecting nerd without time\nconscience does, and plugged in an ethernet cable and installed arch anyway.\nAfter trying what feels like a bazzillion different things (but probably was\ncloser to a monkey performing the same 3 tricks in different order) I\ninstalled NetworkManager.\nAnd the heavens blessed me with Wi-Fi.\nSpirits high I started doing my actual bootstrap routine, and after\ninstalling hyprland et. al. I noticed my next\nproblem: I could not scroll using the trackpad. For the love of all that is\nholy, what is going on with this machine? Is the trackpad registering itself\nas a mouse? No. A tablet? No. A keyboard with a nipple? I mean, maybe?\nI’ll gloss over my fruitless search of the www for answers. Defeated and\ndepressed, I was ready to go to bed to the joyful sound of birds laughing at\nme. Then, while brushing my teeth, I remberered that the touchpad had worked\nfine on Bazzite, so they must do something right, right!?\nTurns out the swell folks over at Bazzite apply patches and compile the linux\nkernel themselves – AND\nEVEN PROVIDE IT ON AUR. Praise be, blessed be their name.\nAnyway, how to try it out? One hour later, after too much reading about\nboot setups and how everything is more complicated than I can even imagine, all\nthat was needed was essentially:\n\nReboot. Now let’s enjoy the modern life that is scrolling.\n","id":"https://ojj.nu/text/asus-rog-flow-z13/","title":"asus rog flow z13"},"https://ojj.nu/text/notes-about-remote-work/":{"body":"So I’m locked out of my apartment for about 7 weeks, with only a laptop and a\nkeyboard.\nHere are some notes about my setup.\n#docker 4 mac\nThere is a native ARM64 build, but it comes with an extensive list of known\nissues. In\nparticular, emulation of x86-based containers is sketchy and the disk\nperformance is not very good\nwhen mounting host folders in the container.\nNormally, I have access to a Windows (home) or Linux (office) machine and\nboth offer a better docker experience compared to MacOS. Since my apartment\nwill continue to have internet access, why run a gimped container setup on my\nMacBook Air when I can do something pointless learn something new??\n#my setup\nI have a Windows machine and a Raspberry Pi at home. My plan? Use Wake-On-LAN\nto wake my Windows machine, run docker on it for work and put it back to\nsleep when done.\nI found a nice little program called wol\nwhich let me save the MAC address of my Windows machine under an alias, which\nmade the wakeup script self-explanatory.\n\nNext up was enabling Wake-On-LAN on my Windows machine, which turned out to be\nquite simple. After a couple of wake-and-sleep cycles later I was confident\nthat this setup would actually work.\nAt this point I could wake the machine from sleep, and since I already had\nenabled the built-in OpenSSH server, I searched online and found an eldritch\ncommand to put it back to sleep. Behold:\n\nNow it was time to automate these steps (as steps in a\ntmuxinator\nproject) and move on to docker shit!\nStarting, stopping and all container interactions worked without any problem.\nThis is my script for port-forwarding ports and starting the backend services\nin a work project:\n\nand maybe an interactive session as well.\n\nThis actually works surprisingly well, now I mostly do:\n\nbring machine up: tmuxinator start workday\nwork on project(s): tmuxinator start/stop xyz\nbring machine down: tmuxinator stop workday\n\n#troubles\nOf course, it was not exactly a smooth start:\n\ngit failed due to something related to a credential manager - “fixed” by switching remote from https to ssh\nazure container registry at $DAYJOB need a ~daily login az acr login which also failed due to similar error - resolved after reading the fucking manual\nand learning about docker credentials\n\n\n","id":"https://ojj.nu/text/notes-about-remote-work/","title":"running docker on windows over ssh"},"https://ojj.nu/text/silvia-pid/":{"body":"So I’ve started my decent into madness espresso and went and bought a\nsecondhand Rancilio Silva:\n\nIt’s a simple machine. A 3-way valve. Vibration pump. Single boiler. Brew and\nsteam thermostats. I honestly think that the most complex part is the\nEU-mandated energy saving module (but don’t ask me about long-lasting boiler\ndesign).\n#the possibly hallucinated problem of temperature control\nMost espresso bullshit science can be reduced to one thing: reproducability.\nThe end goal is to pull a good shot, and to make the process itself repeatable.\nThe general recommendation is to follow a list of steps ranked by impact, and check items off it as you go.\n\nBeans: start with good quality, fresh beans\nRecipe: dosage &gt; ratio &gt; grind size &gt; brew time; dial it in as you go\nPuck prep: it’s very possible to fuck this up; keep it simple\nBrewing pressure: pressure at the group head should be 9 bar\nWater temp: 92°C according to the italian espresso council\nPre-infusion: well, manufacturers need something to sell people new machines, right?\n\nBut this story is about brewing temperature, and my Rancilio Silva has a single,\ninsulated, ~800W boiler fed by a vibration pump. There is a little bit of\nwiring to control the brewer (on/off) with a thermostat (a kind of\nheat-sensitive controller) which heats the boiler until it reaches 80°C.\nIf you haven’t been introduced to the world of regulators, let’s ask\nourselves, how can the boiler heat water to temperature exceeding 80°C when\nthe thermostat switches off at 80°C?\n\nThe heating element is not limited to 80°C. While turning it off will\nprevent the element from getting hotter, any residual heat will still\naffect the water.\nThe thermostat measures the temperature of the boiler (from the outside),\nperhaps simplest thought of as a delayed average temperature of the water inside\nthe boiler.\n\nAll of this is a lot of text to basically say that it is impossible to reliably pull shots with this machine at 92°C.\nHow large effect will this temperature variance have on the taste, you ask.\nNot sure, I answer warily.\n#how to surf on temperate internets\nWhat do people on reddit internet recommend?\n\n“Just temp. surf!”\n\nWhat is this temp. surf you ask?\nTemperature surfing means pushing the brew button, causing hot water to flow into the group head and cold water into the boiler and then waiting for specific amount of time.\nPeople hope that by doing this procedure (and presumably also by praying to every diety known to man) they’ll luck out and eventually start the show at the correct temperature.\nAnd people argue that this works, reliably.\nWell, luckily we have ze germans who don’t believe in voodoo shit and are pragmatic enough to solve this problem with some engineering and electronics, with some open source software sprinkled on top.\nThe gist?\nReplace the brew thermostat with a Proportional Integral Derivative controller.\n#it’s time to u-u-upgrade\nAbout 6 months post-purchase it was finally time to tackle the problem, imagined or not, of water temperature.\nThe first task was to solder, assemble and dryrun the system. Here’s how it looks on my coffee table workbench:\n\nA few mis-wirings, blown sensors and a few incidents of money-not-well-spent later, it’s good to go:\n\nFirmware upload works via USB\nFirmware upload works via Wi-Fi (horay!)\nWeb interface works ~20% of the time (horay?)\n\nNext up, disassembly of the outer shell: a few screws are all that secure the outer chassis to the inner skeleton.\nPictured is the insulated boiler with its two thermostats (brown knobs) on the right side, partially obscured by cabling.\n\nThe two thermostats are for controlling brew and steam temperature separately.\nRancilio’s own manual has the schematics and I actually read it, somewhat appreciative of the similarity with open source software.\nReplacing the brew thermostat is simple once I find a correctly-sized screw to thumb down the sensor to keep it in place.\n\nMounting the solid state relay, power supply and PCB is a little finicky.\nHere’s me doing a final dry-run before breaking any remaining warranty committing myself to gluing the parts to the chassis.\n\nSeveral hours later… it’s done.\nFinding a good place for the OLED screen, however, turns out to be quite the problem:\n\nOh well, I guess I need something to do next time. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n","id":"https://ojj.nu/text/silvia-pid/","title":"rancilio silva part 1"},"https://ojj.nu/things-i-read/":{"body":"A somewhat incomplete reading list.\nBlogs\n\nReliable Signals of Honest Intent\n\nPapers\nAt least the ones I can recall.\nBooks\nMostly fiction; science or fantasy.\n2026\n\n\nThe Devils (The Devils #1) by Joe Abercrombie, currently reading\n\n\nThe Strength of the Few by James Islington (Hierarchy #2)\n\n\n2025\n\n\nProject Hail Mary by Andy Weir\n\n\nThe Mercy of Gods by James S.A.
